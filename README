SensorSafe Project: Remote Data Store (haksoo@cs.ucla.edu)

We use Apache webserver with Django web framework w/ sqlite3 + mongoDB backend.
(sqlite3: for small stuff e.g. userinfo, mongodb: large stuff e.g. sensor data)

+ Why sqlite3 + mongoDB?

  1. Performance
    So we use mongoDB for storing large amount of data only.
    -> Our application: sensor stream data at high sample rate.

    mongoDB is good for write-intensive application.

  2. Clean Code
    But we still want to get the most of out django's backend DB integration, e.g. user admin, so we use sqlite3.
    Also, we have fairly complex combination of JSON privacy rules, and they can be easily modified to mongoDB's JSON query language. 

+ Why Django?
  Its MVCC model is awesome.

+ Why Apache?
  Come on, this is de-facto standard web server!
